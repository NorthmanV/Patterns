# Design Patterns
## Creational
### Abstract factory
Provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder 
Constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.

### Factory method 
Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.

### Prototype 
Creates objects by cloning an existing object.

### Singleton 
Restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

## Structural
### Adapter
Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.

### Bridge
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Composite
Composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.

### Decorator
Dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.

### Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.

### Flyweight
Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.

### Proxy
Provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

## Behavioral
### Chain of responsibility 
Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.

### Command
Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.

### Interpreter 
Implements a specialized language.

### Iterator 
Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### Mediator 
Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.

### Memento 
Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).

### Observer 
Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.

### State
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### Strategy 
Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.

### Template method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.

### Visitor
Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
