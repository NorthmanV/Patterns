# Design Patterns
## Creational
### Adapter
Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.

### Bridge
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Composite
Composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.

### Decorator
Dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.
